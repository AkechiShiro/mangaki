The soundtrack is the best soundtrack I`ve ever heard in an anime. Period. The anime as a whole is VERY original, but the story moves slow.</recommendation>\n",
    "<recommendation type=\"For Fans\" uid=\"371670\">This is a quality anime, certainly interesting for gamers but something kept me from giving it status \"recommended/must see\". I liked it a lot in the beginning, \"The World\" seemed very appealing, especially for me, a gamer familiar with RPG. However, the story progress is very and sometimes painfully slow. I truly enjoyed the soundtrack which is without doubt one of the best music background you can hear in anime. Sadly, the main character of Tsukasa is often irritating and indecision of other characters as well. As the story is gradually falling more and more into angst, I stopped to like it - I guess I just wanted some nice fantasy anime set in a virtual reality. Nevertheless, I rated quite high since Hack deserves it. You will either like it or not. ;)</recommendation>\n",
    "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"299048\">A rare digital plot that has no end to it :)</recommendation>\n",
    "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"43034\">If you have played some old-school MMORPGs and met new friends through them, you owe it to yourself to watch //SIGN.\n",
    "The Anime manages to capture some of the player interactions in those online worlds really well and touches on subjects like escapism, online vs. RL, anonymity and more. All the while a fantastic choral soundtrack accompanies the on-screen exposition.\n",
    "Watching this, I recalled many moments of me playing Lineage 2 and Guild Wars (1) and spending time with my friends online.\n",
    "\n",
    "The anime is definitely not for everyone though. The story is quite convoluted and there are quite a lot of uncertainties left at the end. If you`re looking for something more action orientated or fast paced, stay away from //SIGN or you`ll regret it. The exposition unravels reaaaaly slow and it`s very dialouge heavy. It focuses on the psychological and sociological aspects of MMOs, rather than their battles, quests or other gameplay elements.</recommendation>\n",

He attempts to log out but fails to do so. Being unable to remember what has happened before he awoke, he wanders around aimlessly to find answers. While doing so, system moderators, the Scarlet Knights, suspect that he has been working with hackers, because of a tweaked cat-faced character he had been seen with. Tsukasa finds a magical item, that grants him the power to use the fearful Guardian that will protect him from any harm. To Tsukasa`s dismay it turns out that this guardian can not only easily defeat player characters in the game, but actually badly hurt players in the real world.\n",
    "On his search for truth, Tsukasa encounters the friendly and supportive http://anidb.net/ch3661 [Mimiru], the wise, fatherly http://anidb.net/ch9953 [Bear], the manipulative http://anidb.net/ch9957 [BT], the scrupulous http://anidb.net/ch9954 [Sora], the fun-loving http://anidb.net/ch9955 [Crim], and the mysterious http://anidb.net/ch9956 [Subaru], leader of the Scarlet Knights.

The soundtrack is the best soundtrack I`ve ever heard in an anime. Period. The anime as a whole is VERY original, but the story moves slow.</recommendation>\n",
       "<recommendation type=\"For Fans\" uid=\"371670\">This is a quality anime, certainly interesting for gamers but something kept me from giving it status \"recommended/must see\". I liked it a lot in the beginning, \"The World\" seemed very appealing, especially for me, a gamer familiar with RPG. However, the story progress is very and sometimes painfully slow. I truly enjoyed the soundtrack which is without doubt one of the best music background you can hear in anime. Sadly, the main character of Tsukasa is often irritating and indecision of other characters as well. As the story is gradually falling more and more into angst, I stopped to like it - I guess I just wanted some nice fantasy anime set in a virtual reality. Nevertheless, I rated quite high since Hack deserves it. You will either like it or not. ;)</recommendation>\n",

       "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"43034\">If you have played some old-school MMORPGs and met new friends through them, you owe it to yourself to watch //SIGN.\n",
       "The Anime manages to capture some of the player interactions in those online worlds really well and touches on subjects like escapism, online vs. RL, anonymity and more. All the while a fantastic choral soundtrack accompanies the on-screen exposition.\n",
       "Watching this, I recalled many moments of me playing Lineage 2 and Guild Wars (1) and spending time with my friends online.\n",
       "\n",
       "The anime is definitely not for everyone though. The story is quite convoluted and there are quite a lot of uncertainties left at the end. If you`re looking for something more action orientated or fast paced, stay away from //SIGN or you`ll regret it. The exposition unravels reaaaaly slow and it`s very dialouge heavy. It focuses on the psychological and sociological aspects of MMOs, rather than their battles, quests or other gameplay elements.</recommendation>\n",

Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography and sociology, and also on folklore.</description>\n",

       "<description>Tsukasa was initially a cynical loner, and seemingly arrogant to the other players in The World. Tsukasa tended to avoid others as much as possible and didn`t take any enjoyment in leveling up or participating in events. In fact, his sole enjoyment seemed to come from defying the Crimson Knights. As Tsukasa was slowly befriended by Mimiru, Bear, and Subaru, he began to warm up to them, eventually seeking them out, as well as being sought out by Subaru who came to him for aid when she felt lost. By the end of the series, Tsukasa reveals the kind heart he had kept hidden for so long.</description>\n",

Her avatar appears as a teenage girl dressed in an armored bikini top, and a short skirt, with large greaves on her legs. Mimiru plays as a \"tough-it-out-through-anything\" player, who is poor at planning things out and following through on them. She meets Tsukasa and soon becomes one of the few he trusts and he eventually sees her as a friend. She also teams up with Bear, who she refers to as an \"old man\", and spends considerable time in the series attempting to figure out what Bear`s career is in real life.</description>\n",
